 Attendance System Using Facial Recognition
 
This AI project automates Attendance System Using Facial Recognition technology. It captures real-time video via webcam, detects and recognizes faces using machine learning (LBPH algorithm), and logs attendance with timestamps into a text file.
Artificial Intelligence enables **accurate, contactless, and real-time** identification of individuals, reducing manual errors and saving time in environments like schools, offices, and events. AI makes the system intelligent enough to recognize faces even with slight changes in appearance.


 Key Features:

* Real-time AI-based face recognition
* Avoids duplicate entries (30-sec gap logic)
* Attendance saved with time and date
* Displays names or "Unknown" live on camera feed
  

 Output Example:
`Alia, 2025-06-11 19:12:40`
